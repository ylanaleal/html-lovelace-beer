# html-lovelace-beer
To train my skills and further my studies, I created a website, and the visual identity of a fictional beer, called Lovelace, in honor of Ada Lovelace. I created three types of beer: Ipa_CSS, Lager_HTML and Stout_Java, in reference to the computer programming I'm learning. The site has three pages, the main, products and contact page.
